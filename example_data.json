Chiu examines the opportunities and challenges of these impacts for teachers and students, proposes a framework and a set of principles for the two areas with examples, and suggests learning outcomes. AI in K-12 education is one of the most important global strategic initiatives since it has made and continues to make impacts on education and the job market. Including AI technology and topics in K-12 education not only helps children understand what AI technologies are and how they work, but also inspires future workplace readiness and potential AI researchers, ethical designers, and software developers. However, educators and AI experts in general realize that planning AI-related education is very challenging. It involves integrating the topics or technologies into the curriculum, necessitating teacher development to address the gaps in knowledge, addressing educational inequity, and securing equipment and resources.

Its governments have delivered continuous economic growth for more than three decades, even against the turmoil of a global pandemic. And the country\u2019s highly competitive elections and strong political institutions operate within a stable and balanced federal system. In Australia\u2019s Evolving Democracy a team of leading academic authors use an audit approach to critically explore national government institutions, as well as state- and territory-level politics, and to examine how each has contributed to or held back Australian political life as it has changed and diversified. For instance, the top two parties\u2019 monopoly of governance has only begun to adjust to a modern transition to multi-party politics, although balanced voting systems for two-house legislatures have allowed for some adaptation. To date, the country has successfully avoided both rancorous populist politics (as in the USA) and serious governance decline (as in the UK). Each of the book\u2019s 28 chapters tackles one institution or issue, outlining recent developments along with an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, to fully evaluate the state of Australian democracy in the 21st century. In doing so, the authors draw key lessons for other democracies, showing in detail how robust major and micro-institutions can guard against democratic \u2018backsliding\u2019 and policy failures. This comprehensive audit also highlights scope for potential democratic improvements. Australia continues to confront the challenges of partisan political barriers to addressing climate change and improving the situation of First Nations peoples, redressing modern social inequalities, and responding to popular mistrust of government and politicians.

The destruction and concealment of S\u00e1mi objects in both private and museum collections worldwide have impacted S\u00e1mi knowledge systems, disrupting local ways of knowing. Appreciation and reappropriation are important acts of decolonization which seek to create openings for reconnection to traditions, languages, and practices that were forcibly suppressed in the past. Western memory institutions such as museums, archives, and galleries have had a great impact on how heritage has been collected, stored, conserved, and organized within closed walls and glass cases. As the new museology movement developed in the 1990s, numerous examples revealed how difficult it became for researchers and public alike to access heritage. Considering the proliferation of cultural interventions and the growth of S\u00e1mi mobilization, which calls into question assumptions about how best to activate and experience S\u00e1mi cultural heritage and what constitutes appropriate stewardship, this book sheds light on initiatives to return artefacts to the S\u00e1mi community. With particular attention to the ways in which S\u00e1mi self-determination and the shifting boundaries between Indigenous and settler identities are articulated, challenged, and renegotiated, it draws on approaches from critical museology and Indigenous methodologies to explore the initiation, experience, and operationalizing of restitution projects. This book will therefore appeal to scholars of cultural studies, anthropology, sociology, and museum and heritage studies, as well as to those interested in questions of repatriation, restitution, and healing processes.", "publisher": "Taylor & Francis", "imprint": "Routledge", "published": 2024, "docType": "book", "subject": ["Norway", "Sami", "Scandinavia", "S\u00e1mi", "S\u00e1mi peoples", "S\u00e1pmi", "anthropology", "appropriation", "archives", "artefacts", "case studies", "cultural heritage", "cultural studies", "decolonisation", "decolonization", "healing", "heritage", "libraries", "museology", "museum studies", "museums", "repatriation", "restitution", "sociology"], "classification": ["G", "GL", "GLZ", "J", "JB", "JBC", "JBCC", "JBS", "JBSL", "JH", "JHB", "N", "NH", "NHT", "NHTQ"], "belongsTo": {"series": "Memory Studies: Global Constellations", "seriesNumber": null}, "numberOfPages": "286", "identifier": "https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/95781", "doi": "10.4324/9781003426318", "isbn": ["9781003426318", "9781032547176", "9781032547190", "9781040261866", "9781040261880"], "licence": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}, "links": {"href": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/95781/1/9781040261866.pdf", "rel": "http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access", "type": "application/pdf"}, "images": {"href": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/95781/7/9781040261866.pdf.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, {"metadata": {"title": "South Asia on the Move", "subtitle": "Mobilities, Mobilizations, Maneuvers", "author": null, "editor": ["Bedi, Tarini", "Linder, Benjamin"], "language": ["eng"], "modified": "2024-12-18 04:00:29", "description": "This book sustains and expands the new mobilities paradigm by focusing such theoretical advances on South Asian scholarship.

This volume extends earlier approaches by centering South Asia as a critical site through which scholars can advance new empirical research, develop fresh theoretical tools, diversify mobilities studies, and pose a challenge to predominant models. Through a diverse set of interdisciplinary chapters, 'South Asia on the Move' makes a sustained argument about the value of decentering (im)mobilities research.

The Essentials is one of the earliest Chinese anthologies designed to educate rulers in cultivating an ethical character and governing the state. Commissioned for the Tang emperor Taizong in the 620s, the Essentials articulates a distinctive political philosophy through a collection of excerpts from earlier canonical, historical, and masters writings, and their commentaries. Examining the Essentials and its transmission in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam through the lens of cultural memory, Ngo explores the foundation, conduct, and impact of Zhenguan rulership, which became synonymous with good governance among later generations of ruling elites, scholars, and historians in China and beyond. By connecting the textual discourse with an analysis of its use and reception across the region, Ngo demonstrates that the Essentials was a key source of Confucian political thought and practice during the early Tang dynasty. In accounting for the place of the Essentials in political advice literature, Ngo illustrates how it drew from the ancient Confucian heritage and was still responsive to contemporaneous political concerns, suggesting that the Essentials played a part in the success of Zhenguan political practice. Ordering Tang China also includes the first English-language translations of portions of the seventh-century anthology, with reference to partial translations published in nine languages. Utilizing the theory of cultural memory to study the Essentials not only opens a fresh approach to learning about the imperial consumption of literature, as well as the theory and practice of emperorship, but also offers a case study for how to study Chinese governance literature, including its \u201cmirror for princes\u201d genre.", "publisher": "Lever Press", "imprint": null, "published": 2024, "docType": "book", "subject": ["Di fan", "East Asia history", "Emperor Taizong", "Essentials for Bringing about Order from Assembled Texts", "Golden Mirror", "Heian Japan", "Jin jing", "Kamakura Japan", "Li Shimin", "Model for an Emperor", "Qunshu liyao", "Qunshu zhengyao", "Qunshu zhiyao", "Tang China", "Tang dynasty", "Tokugawa Japan", "Wei Zheng", "Zhenguan reign", "Zhenguan zhengyao", "administrative culture", "art of emperorship", "art of rulership", "cultural memory theory", "mirror for princes", "political advice literature", "political education"], "classification": ["J", "JN", "JNB", "N", "NH", "NHF"], "belongsTo": {"series": "ASIANetwork Books", "seriesNumber": null}, "numberOfPages": "315", "identifier": "https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/93564", "doi": "10.3998/mpub.14467609", "isbn": ["9781643150703", "9781643150710"], "licence": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}, "links": {"href": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/93564/1/9781643150710.epub", "rel": "http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access", "type": "application/pdf"}, "images": {"href": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/93564/2/9781643150710.epub.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, {"metadata": {"title": "Chapter 12 Kashmir\u2019s Crafts Women", "subtitle": "Tacit, Embodied Knowledge and its value in Post\u2011conflict Reconstruction", "author": ["Raina, Neelam"], "editor": null, "language": ["eng"], "modified": "2024-12-18 04:00:28", "description": "This book explores the crafts and performing arts of South Asia through a focus on labour and livelihood. It brings to light little-researched angles of social and political economies of culture and the ways in which they have shifted and changed in different historical eras and different political, economic, and social formations up to the present. In particular, through this focus on labour and livelihood, the contributors analyse the extensive parallels and similarities of arts and crafts on the one hand and music and performing arts on the other, ranging from questions of lineage, transmission, class/caste/community, professional versus amateur performers and artisans, to the impact of globalisation, neoliberal reforms, and mediatisation. Given the role of gender inequalities and differences within caste/community-based cultural production in South Asia across visual, material, and performing arts and crafts, this interdisciplinary perspective is particularly salient and links together broader sociological and historical trends in South Asian cultural or creative economies. Creative economies of culture explores labour and livelihood through a gamut of crafts and performing arts ranging from courtly and classical to commissioned to mass-produced, and in epochs ranging from colonial or feudal to globalised and neoliberal. In the process, it revisits, refines, or revises notions of social and cultural capital; socio-economic mobility; the value, role, and agency of crafts and performing arts; and the status of their artisans and performers. Original chapters written by contributors with an interdisciplinary background look at the survival and adaption of traditional artisanal communities; traditional forms of practice; historical shifts such as colonialism, industrialisation, and nationalism; as well as modern industries and institutions, including technologies of mass production and creative entrepreneurship. This book contextualises current debates within art, craft, music, and dance in South Asia. It develops new theoretical understandings of creative culture through a focus on labour and contributes to a range of social sciences, arts, and humanities disciplines, including South Asian studies, Ethnomusicology, Crafts and Design, Economic Anthropology, (Historical) Sociology and (Historical) Economics, Cultural History, Human Geography, and Creative Industries and Economies.", "publisher": "Taylor & Francis", "imprint": "Routledge", "published": 2024, "docType": "chapter", "subject": ["Crafts", "Embodied Knowledge", "Gender", "Identity", "Material Cultures", "Resilience", "Tacit Knowledge", "Textiles", "Women", "and Sustainable Practices"], "classification": ["G", "GT", "GTM", "J", "JB", "JBS", "JBSL"], "belongsTo": {"series": null, "seriesNumber": null}, "numberOfPages": "12", "identifier": "https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/95824", "doi": "10.4324/9781351031028-13", "isbn": ["9781032887982", "9781138492172", "9781351031028"], "licence": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}, "links": {"href": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/95824/1/9781351031028_10.4324_9781351031028-13.pdf", "rel": "http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access", "type": "application/pdf"}, "images": {"href": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/95824/2/9781351031028_10.4324_9781351031028-13.pdf.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, {"metadata": {"title": "Future Practices of Citizenship in Asia and the West", "subtitle": "Care of the Self (Volume III)", "author": null, "editor": ["Amalina, Fildzah Husna", "Azlan, Nurul Azreen", "Bracken, Gregory", "Rab\u00e9, Paul", "Siu, Kin Wai Michael", "Song, Lily", "Taylor, John", "Waruwu, Barui Kurniawan"], "language": ["eng"], "modified": "2024-12-18 04:00:28", "description": "Future Practices of Citizenship in Asia and the West investigates some of the greatest challenges facing society in the twenty-first century, including the struggle for rights and recognition by indigenous peoples, women, migrants, and the young, as well as the dampening effects some government responses to COVID-19 have had on artistic freedom and citizen participation.

Byzantine dress is considered from within and outside of the Empire and examines both artifactual remains as well as emphasizing studies that elucidate Byzantine dress when few or no artifacts exist. Byzantine Dress: A Guide tackles current conceptual frameworks in the first three chapters and considers identity and sartorial signaling among Byzantines as well as foreigners in images as well as actual items of dress. A second section addresses material considerations, reflecting on construction and its effect on value. The interpretation of archaeological material is analyzed, along with reconstruction and context. Dress as part of rituals\u2014at court, church, and in various ceremonies\u2014is the focus of the third section. The final two chapters bring Byzantine dress into conversation with dress studies more broadly. A discursive chapter argues for a fashion system within the Byzantine Empire, which has been largely seen as pre-dating the notion of fashion. The final chapter concerns the display, interpretation, and conservation of fragmentary material in a museum context. This book aims toward a general audience new to the subject of Byzantine dress. Specialists in Byzantine studies and dress studies more generally will find the attention to current scholarship and archaeological interpretation invaluable for research, and the book will also appeal to an audience new to the subject of Byzantine dress.", "publisher": "Taylor & Francis", "imprint": "Routledge", "published": 2024, "docType": "chapter", "subject": ["byzantium", "culture", "dress", "fashion", "society"], "classification": ["N", "NH"], "belongsTo": {"series": null, "seriesNumber": null}, "numberOfPages": "36", "identifier": "https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/95797", "doi": "10.4324/9781003096023-3", "isbn": ["9780367560003", "9781003096023", "9781032787121"], "licence": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}, "links": {"href": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/95797/1/9781003096023_10.4324_9781003096023-3.pdf", "rel": "http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access", "type": "application/pdf"}, "images": {"href": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/95797/2/9781003096023_10.4324_9781003096023-3.pdf.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, {"metadata": {"title": "Chapter 1 Understanding in science and beyond", "subtitle": null, "author": ["de Regt, Henk"], "editor": null, "language": ["eng"], "modified": "2024-12-18 04:00:25", "description": "This volume explores how understanding relates to conscious experience.

It thereby connects the most recent research on responsibility and rationality in a unifying dialectic. How can we be responsible for our attitudes if we cannot normally choose what we believe, desire, feel, and intend? This problem has received much attention during the last decades, both in epistemology and ethics. Yet, its connections to discussions about reasons and rationality have been largely overlooked. The book has five main goals. First, it reinterprets the problem of responsibility for attitudes as a problem about the normativity of rationality. Second, it connects substantive and structural rationality by drawing on debates about responsibility. Third, it supports recent accounts of the normativity of rationality by explicitly defending the view that epistemic reasons and other \u2018right\u2011kind\u2019 reasons are genuine normative reasons, and it does so by drawing on recent discussions about epistemic blame. Fourth, it breaks the stalemate between rationalist and voluntarist accounts of mental responsibility by proposing a hybrid view. Finally, it argues that being irrational can warrant moral blame, thus revealing an unnoticed normative force of rational requirements.

Chiu examines the opportunities and challenges of these impacts for teachers and students, proposes a framework and a set of principles for the two areas with examples, and suggests learning outcomes. AI in K-12 education is one of the most important global strategic initiatives since it has made and continues to make impacts on education and the job market. Including AI technology and topics in K-12 education not only helps children understand what AI technologies are and how they work, but also inspires future workplace readiness and potential AI researchers, ethical designers, and software developers. However, educators and AI experts in general realize that planning AI-related education is very challenging. It involves integrating the topics or technologies into the curriculum, necessitating teacher development to address the gaps in knowledge, addressing educational inequity, and securing equipment and resources.

In an era characterised by the ceaseless flux of global dynamics, traditional paradigms of warfare have become increasingly obsolete. The pursuit of victory no longer lies in the fixation upon past conflicts but rather in the discerning assessment of and adaptation to the challenges that will shape the conflicts of tomorrow. This innovative work dissects the barriers that have thus far hindered the realisation of this potential. Furthermore, it challenges the status quo and advances a series of recommendations poised to steer international militaries towards success in the theatre of contemporary conflicts. Drawing from their extensive involvement with defence forces worldwide, the authors introduce concepts such as military design thinking as catalytic instruments of change. Through introspective reflections and real-world case studies, they present implications for mitigating cognitive biases, heralding a transformative epoch in military operations. It is this very transformation that furnishes militaries with the capacity to surge ahead of their adversaries, a capability proving to be indispensable in modern warfare. Offering a well-illuminated path for military entities to adapt and flourish within an ever-evolving global landscape, this book will be of much interest to students of military studies, security studies, and international relations, as well as military professionals and leaders in the field.

She soon came into conflict with church authorities over the moral accountability of Catholics suffering from mental health issues. The dispute centred around the competencies of psychiatrists versus priests. In this book, Monteiro examines Terruwe's role in this fundamental conflict within post-war Dutch mental health care. In the 1970s, Terruwe reinvented herself as the discoverer of frustration neurosis, a condition rooted in affective deficits stemming from early childhood. She became a phenomenon, attracting prominent supporters as well as thousands of listeners, readers, and clients. Monteiro delves into Terruwe\u2019s personal life and professional career, with a focus on gender, religion, and professional authority. This book analyses sources that Terruwe deliberately excluded from her personal archive.

New York, Toronto, and Tel Aviv are currently redeveloping giant landfills into parks to much&nbsp;fanfare. The park redevelopments may be seen as an attempt to erase or assuage the decades of problematic waste-disposal policy that led to the creation of such large landfills. Booster rhetoric underscores this point, such as promoting how the parks will be a \u201cgreen lung\u201d for the city. This book contextualizes these redevelopments by offering a historical analysis, providing a greater understanding of the past, current, and future potential issues. It goes on to analyze the language and media coverage surrounding former waste sites becoming park redevelopments, including how cities use art to promote their image and gain cultural relevance. By engaging with both the works of waste historians and literature on waste and discard studies, the book provides theoretical models for analyzing the role of power in municipal systems, as well as human and ecological impacts on waste. It concludes with an analysis of the features necessary for landfill parks to be successful.

Military force involves death and destruction, as well as interfering in other countries\u2019 domestic affairs. But, crucially, non-intervention is also controversial. When confronted with humanitarian crises abroad, many feel that outsiders are not only justified in using force to halt the abuses, but that they must do so. The Ethics of Humanitarian Intervention: An Introduction offers a guide to these ethical debates. In clear and informative style Jonathan Parry explores the following topics: The morality of defending others, including the \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 (R2P). State sovereignty and self-determination as barriers to intervention. The possibility of consensual intervention. Just causes for intervention: what kinds of human rights abuses warrant intervention? The effectiveness of intervention: does it work in practice? Alternatives to intervention, including aiding rebels, economic sanctions, and providing aid. Whether there is a duty to intervene. Examples of intervention \u2013 including the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Liberia, and Libya \u2013 are used to illustrate the ethical dilemmas in question. The arguments of important theorists of intervention, such as John Stuart Mill, Michael Walzer and Jeff McMahan, are also explained clearly and critically. Each chapter concludes with questions for discussion and reflection. The Ethics of Humanitarian Intervention: An Introduction is ideal reading for students and researchers in philosophy, applied ethics, politics and international relations.

In addition to topics related to the practice of librarianship, and to libraries and archives as DH-friendly institutions, we address issues of importance to library and archives workers themselves: labour, sustainability, organisation and infrastructure, and focused professional practices that reflect the increasingly important role of librarians and archivists as active research partners. One of the central motifs of this book is that the \u201ctwo\u201d fields\u2014DH, on the one hand, and the library, archival, and information sciences on the other\u2014are in fact deeply intertwined, productively interdependent, and mutually reinforcing. We place these on an equal footing, considering how they coexist and collaborate in equal partnership. This Companion will be of interest to DH practitioners and theorists, especially those who work in libraries and archives, and those who work with them. Likewise, \u201cnon-DH\u201d (or \u201cnot-yet-DH\u201d) library and archival administrators, reference and public service librarians, cataloguers, and even those who work primarily with the tangible collections will find here echoes and implications of the most venerable traditions and practices of our shared profession.

The contributions gathered in this volume highlight the need for a better understanding of a region that hosts a vast amount of culturally and linguistically diverse material, often in a precarious state of conservation. Diversity Across the Arabian Peninsula argues for the importance of holistic, community-based, and interdisciplinary approaches to linguistic endangerment and deep social and cultural changes: there is no documentation of language without attention to language use, the material lifeworld and its ecology, and social and cultural setting.

How do we know that another person really wants to have sex with us? Why do people sometimes give in to sex that they are not in the mood for? And how come it is sometimes difficult to draw a sharp line between sex and assault? Dynamics of Sexual Consent addresses these questions based on deeply personal interviews with 20 Swedish women and men of various ages and sexual orientations. In doing so, it contributes to understandings of sexual consent and sexual grey areas through its combination of conceptual rigour, analytical detail and empirical richness. While starting in the legal definition of consent as voluntary participation, the book broadens the discussion to a wider sociological and philosophical sphere where gendered power dynamics and relational dependencies challenge simplistic understandings of voluntariness. Contesting tendencies to see miscommunication as the key problem related to consent, it shows that emotional aspects are often the main factor standing in the way of genuinely consensual interactions. While the analysis is informed by a gender perspective emphasizing the gendered power asymmetries of heterosexuality, it also foregrounds men\u2019s vulnerability and the power dynamics of samesex interactions. A key argument of the book is that, given the contextual and ambiguous nature of sexual interactions, it is impossible to delineate unequivocal and concretely applicable guidelines for what counts as consent.

What I said can\u2019t be true, for if it were, it would be false. So it must be false\u2014but then it would be true after all. Attempts at a solution to this contradiction led such thinkers to develop their theories of meaning, reference and truth. A popular response, until it was attacked at length by Thomas Bradwardine in the early 1320s, was to dismiss such self-reference as impossible: no term (here, \u2018false\u2019) could refer to (or in medieval terms, \u201csupposit for\u201d) a whole, e.g., a proposition, of which it is part. In light of Bradwardine\u2019s criticisms, Walter Segrave, writing around 1330, defended so-called restrictivism (restrictio) by claiming that such paradoxes exhibited a fallacy of accident. The classic example of this fallacy, the first of Aristotle\u2019s fallacies independent of language, is the Hidden Man puzzle: you know Coriscus, Coriscus is the one approaching, but you don\u2019t know the one approaching since, e.g., he is wearing a mask. But Aristotle\u2019s account is unclear and Segrave, building on ideas of Giles of Rome and Walter Burley, shows how the fallacy turns on an equivocation over the supposition of the middle term or one of the extremes in a syllogism. Thereby, Segrave is able to counter Bradwardine\u2019s arguments one by one and defend the restrictivist solution.

Communism in East Central Europe had cracks from the beginning, as uprisings in East Germany in 1953 and Hungary in 1956 demonstrated. But with the establishment of the Independent Trade Union Solidarity in Poland in the Summer of 1980, communism went into steady decline and, between 1988 and 1991, crumbled. What followed has been an unsteady transition to various forms of often corrupt pluralism with democracy doing best in the Czech Republic (with the exception of the years 2017\u20132021) and Slovenia, and worst in Hungary, Albania, Serbia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Focusing on the former British colonies of Kenya and Australia, both united by a discourse of developmentalism, the book draws attention to the critical role that the destructions of ecologies has historically played, and continues to play, in the genocide of Indigenous and place-based peoples. It synthesises radical political ecology with a political-economic approach to illuminate the nexus between the inherently genocidal and ecocidal properties of the capitalist global system and the manner in which the ecocidal logic of capital intersects with settler and post-colonial structures. In exploring the genocidal effects of climate governance and market environmentalism on Indigenous peoples in Kenya and forms of energy extraction on Indigenous groups in Australia, the book also draws on original interviews to prioritise the lived experiences of, and give voice to, the groups that have suffered structural violence and social harms.

How do we know that another person really wants to have sex with us? Why do people sometimes give in to sex that they are not in the mood for? And how come it is sometimes difficult to draw a sharp line between sex and assault? Dynamics of Sexual Consent addresses these questions based on deeply personal interviews with 20 Swedish women and men of various ages and sexual orientations. In doing so, it contributes to understandings of sexual consent and sexual grey areas through its combination of conceptual rigour, analytical detail and empirical richness. While starting in the legal definition of consent as voluntary participation, the book broadens the discussion to a wider sociological and philosophical sphere where gendered power dynamics and relational dependencies challenge simplistic understandings of voluntariness. Contesting tendencies to see miscommunication as the key problem related to consent, it shows that emotional aspects are often the main factor standing in the way of genuinely consensual interactions. While the analysis is informed by a gender perspective emphasizing the gendered power asymmetries of heterosexuality, it also foregrounds men\u2019s vulnerability and the power dynamics of samesex interactions. A key argument of the book is that, given the contextual and ambiguous nature of sexual interactions, it is impossible to delineate unequivocal and concretely applicable guidelines for what counts as consent. To compensate for the lack of universal, fail-safe rules, what is needed is an intensified collective reflection on consent and sexual grey areas, which can make individuals better equipped to identify and respect their own and others\u2019 boundaries.

This book explores how concepts of adulthood have changed over time in Britain and the United States from 1350 to the present day through eleven case studies. Ideas of adulthood are currently under intense scrutiny, as individuals increasingly reach midlife without necessarily acquiring the 'traditional' markers of maturity. Yet this volume shows that this is not a uniquely turbulent period, and it does not represent the overturning of norms that were previously settled and unquestioned. Expectations for adults have altered over time, just as other age-categories such as childhood, adolescence and old age have been shaped by their cultural and social context. In historicising adulthood, this collection is the first to employ adulthood as a category of historical analysis, arguing that consideration of age is crucial for all scholarship that addresses power and inequality. Collectively, the authors explore four key ideas: adulthood as both burden and benefit; adulthood as a relational category; collective versus individual definitions of adulthood; and adulthood as a static definition. The book also engages with the intersectional identities of gender, race, class, sexuality and disability, and how these affect understandings of adulthood: who gets to be an adult, and who decides?", "publisher": "University of London Press", "imprint": "University of London Press", "published": 2024, "docType": "book", "subject": ["adolescence", "adulthood", "ageing", "childhood", "chronological age", "life course", "life-cycle", "old age"], "classification": ["J", "JB", "JBS", "JBSP", "JBSP3", "N", "NH", "NHT", "NHTB"], "belongsTo": {"series": "New Historical Perspectives", "seriesNumber": null}, "numberOfPages": "290", "identifier": "https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/95747", "doi": "10.14296/tpsq9748", "isbn": ["9781908590824", "9781908590831", "9781908590848", "9781908590855", "9781915249845"], "licence": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}, "links": {"href": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/95747/1/9781908590848.pdf", "rel": "http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access", "type": "application/pdf"}, "images": {"href": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/95747/7/9781908590848.pdf.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, {"metadata": {"title": "The Struggle You Can\u2019t See", "subtitle": "Experiences of Neurodivergent and Invisibly Disabled Students in Higher Education", "author": ["Lierman, Ash"], "editor": null, "language": ["eng"], "modified": "2024-12-12 04:01:24", "description": "This book offers a comprehensive review of current research on the higher education experiences of neurodivergent undergraduate students and those with invisible disabilities.

The inclusion of students with chronic illnesses is particularly timely, given the rising prevalence of long COVID symptoms and other lasting health impacts among university-aged individuals. Moreover Ash Lierman, who has extensive experience of serving students marginalized students, gives voice to this community, thus providing both a synthesis of existing research, and highlighting the needs and challenges of the students themselves.

Written to guide both the general public and carers and professionals in health contexts, Dancing explores the ways in which dance is being utilised to tackle health challenges, including fall prevention, depression and Parkinson\u2019s. Prioritising safe and inclusive practices, dance experts and advocates Noyale Colin and Kathryn Stamp equip readers with practical ideas for using dance and movement in developing their bodily awareness, sense of self and engagement with others, key factors in maintaining healthy identities and improving social relationships. Drawing on studies which reveal contemporary ideas about non-clinical and community-based methods for health and wellbeing through dance, Colin and Stamp offer a range of guided activities for people to undertake, information on how to get involved in dance and over a dozen case studies to inspire the exploration of dance\u2019s unique power as both a physical and a creative activity. Channelling a new application for an ancient creative practice, Dancing encourages all of us, no matter our age, circumstances or ability, to rediscover this beloved form of movement.", "publisher": "Emerald Publishing", "imprint": null, "published": 2024, "docType": "book", "subject": ["Creative activity", "Dance and movement", "Health management", "Inclusive practice", "Mental well-being", "Non-clinical treatment", "Physical challenges", "Social engagement"], "classification": ["M", "MB", "MBN", "MBNH", "MBP", "V", "VF", "VFD"], "belongsTo": {"series": "Arts for Health", "seriesNumber": null}, "numberOfPages": "161", "identifier": "https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/95700", "doi": null, "isbn": ["9781837539123", "9781837539147", "9781837539154"], "licence": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}, "links": {"href": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/95700/1/9781837539123.pdf", "rel": "http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access", "type": "application/pdf"}, "images": {"href": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/95700/3/9781837539123.pdf.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, {"metadata": {"title": "More-Than-Human Histories of Latin America and the Caribbean", "subtitle": "Decentring the Human in Environmental History", "author": null, "editor": ["Diogo de Carvalho Cabral", "Gasc\u00f3n, Margarita", "Vasques Vital, Andr\u00e9", "de Carvalho Cabral, Diogo"], "language": ["eng"], "modified": "2024-12-12 04:00:51", "description": "The Latin American and Caribbean regions\u2019 historical trajectories have been shaped by complex human-nonhuman interactions.

This book shows, from a hitherto unexamined perspective, how Hispanic America was a forerunner in the reforms of the viceregal courts, which in turn reshaped the paradigm of government and interaction of the distant kingdoms. From then on, the Hispanic Monarchy shifted its interests towards America, in a reorganisation of its territories that led it not only to fight for its resilience, but also to strengthen its leading role in the international politics it had inherited from the Bourbon dynasty.

The natures of our oblations characterize our relationships to objects great and small, e.g., Lords and loved ones, groups and masses of signifiers. Oblative transactions promise meaning, yet we are full of uncertainty. What is it that cries out for oblation? How do we hear its voice? Are we, in fact, called, or do we, on the contrary, offer every bit gratuit?

In this book, J. McKenzie Alexander argues that a new defence is urgently needed because, in the decades since the end of the Cold War, many of the values of the Open Society have come under threat once again. Populist agendas on both the left and right threaten to undermine fundamental principles that underpin liberal democracies, so that what were previously seen as virtues of the Open Society are now, by many people, seen as vices, dangers, or threats. The Open Society as an Enemy interrogates four interconnected aspects of the Open Society: cosmopolitanism, transparency, the free exchange of ideas, and communitarianism. Each of these is analysed in depth, drawing out the implications for contemporary social questions such as the free movement of people, the erosion of privacy, no-platforming and the increased political and social polarisation that is fuelled by social media. In re-examining the consequences for all of us of these attacks on free societies, Alexander calls for resistance to the forces of reaction. But he also calls for the concept of the Open Society to be rehabilitated and advanced. In doing this, he argues, there is an opportunity to re-think the kind of society we want to create, and to ensure it is achievable and sustainable. This forensic defence of the core principles of the Open Society is an essential read for anyone wishing to understand some of the powerful social currents that have engulfed public debates in recent years, and what to do about them. Early praise for The Open Society as an Enemy \"\"Many people have waded into the culture wars, but very few have rigorously and engagingly examined why the way we think about each other is changing.

This carefully curated collection of articles compellingly argues that the retranslation of canonical religious texts is a multi-faceted phenomenon. With cases ranging in time from the early Reformation to the present, and traversing linguistic contexts from Russia to Sweden, Slovenia to Saudi Arabia, the essays capture diverse dimensions of retranslation work. The collection demonstrates that retranslations of such texts manifest in different forms, depending on the religious, political and societal circumstances, the targeted audiences, and the status of existing translations. Their reception too may vary greatly, depending on those same circumstances.
